Ludum Dare 46 :Scratch Board:

KEEP IT ALIVE

Game should be called:

( Kind of misleading because you don't actually plant things )
Reforestation...

THOUGHTS:
This is the file that contains all of my scratch board ideas in text.
Org mode EMACS 26, and maybe summaries.

Maybe this'll be cool,
make the menu look cooler,

and make it resolution independent.

I should probably show cards depicting the enemies
that are going to show up in the round.

That way the strategy part seems fairer?

Also to make the game less easy I should probably have enemies
try to target turrets if they're closer than the tree sometimes.

Maybe there should be an upgrade system, to like... Water the tree
or give it fertilizer or build fencing so it doesn't get hurt as easily

IDEAS:

- literal "It"

- Plants
  - Plants vs Zombies
  - Some Tower Defense Game about defending the last plant on Earth.
    
    So... You have a plant in the center of the screen,
    and you have these points that you can use to buy tower upgrades and
    buildings. Like guards or sentries that you can use to protect the plant.
    
    Plot:

    The year is 3450
    
    and pollution and global warning have taken a large toil on the world.
    Unfortunately greedy humans decided to chop down every tree on Earth
    for wood and stuff.
    
    As a group of environmentalists, you will protect the last known tree
    on the planet from all these lumberjacks.
    
    Enemies:

    Basic Lumberjack - Kind of slow, moderately tough
    Skinny Lumberjack - Really fast, really weak
    Fat Lumberjack - Really slow, really really tough (boss)
    Anarchist - Kind of fast, but just temporarily disarms "tower" / "weapon"
    Logging Machines - Really slow, extra tough, maybe has multiple layers of armor?
    Anthrophormorphic Ant
    
    Buildings:
    
    Rock launcher / Cannon : Really cheap, does okay damage. Slow fire rate. Little bit of knockback.
    Boulder Cannon : Better version of rock launcher. Very slow.
    
    Freeze pack : Low damage, moderately expensive, slows down enemy.
    
    Repeater : Low damage, high rate of fire, moderately expensive.
    
    Trip Mine : Walk over, kaboom! Moderately expensive?
    
    
    Should I implement player based running placement.
    Or invisible god placement like normal tower defense games?
